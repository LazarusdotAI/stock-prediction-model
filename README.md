Stock Prediction Model with Real-Time Monitoring and AI Integration
Stock Prediction Model with Real-Time Monitoring, Predicto, and AI Integration
Overview
This project is a comprehensive stock prediction system that combines machine learning models, reinforcement learning agents, real-time market data, and AI-driven sentiment analysis. A critical component of the system is Predicto's API, which enhances predictions with market forecasts and helps fine-tune model performance through comparison and backtesting.

Features
Data Integration: Pulls historical data, news, and sentiment from APIs (FMP, NewsAPI, Twitter).
Machine Learning Ensemble Models: Uses XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM, and GRU for predictions.
Reinforcement Learning: Adaptive trade strategies with PPO, A2C, and DDPG.
Predicto Forecasts:
Fetches alternative market forecasts and integrates them into the prediction pipeline.
Backtests model performance by comparing predictions with Predicto’s insights.
Explainable AI: SHAP values for interpreting model decisions.
Backtesting with Monte Carlo Simulations: Validates predictions over historical data.
Portfolio Optimization: Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity methods.
Real-Time Alerts: Monitors volatility and sends alerts for market movements.
GPT-4 Integration: Allows users to query stock-related insights via a chatbot interface.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed.
Git installed to clone the repository.
Virtual environment (recommended) to isolate dependencies.
Installation and Setup
1. Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/test.git
cd test
2. Create a Virtual Environment:
bash
Copy code
conda create -n stock-env python=3.8
conda activate stock-env
3. Install Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Add API Keys:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:
makefile
Copy code
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_bearer_token
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
PREDICTO_API_KEY=your_predicto_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Running the Application
Run the Main Script:

bash
Copy code
python extended_base_model.py
Access the Dashboard:

Open your browser and go to:
http://127.0.0.1:8050
Usage
Enter a Stock Symbol (e.g., AAPL) in the dashboard to retrieve real-time predictions and sentiment analysis.
Compare Predictions with Predicto Forecasts:
View Predicto's insights alongside your model’s predictions to detect discrepancies.
Use this comparison to fine-tune your model.
Monitor Portfolio and Market Regimes:
Track the Kelly Criterion and risk parity allocations for your portfolio.
Ask GPT-4 Questions:
Use the query box to ask questions such as:
“What’s the outlook for Tesla?”
“Is AAPL a good buy right now?”
Receive Alerts for significant market changes (e.g., >5% drop in prices).
Predicto Integration and Usage
What is Predicto?
Predicto provides forecasting insights and market predictions via API, helping refine stock predictions.
How It Works in the System:
The model compares its own forecasts with Predicto’s predictions to ensure accuracy.
If discrepancies are detected, the model fine-tunes itself through additional training.
Potential Issues and Troubleshooting
Predicto API Failures:

If Predicto’s API is down or rate-limited, predictions may skip comparison. A warning will be printed in the console.
Dependencies Not Found:

If certain packages are missing, install them manually:
bash
Copy code
pip install <package-name>
Port Conflict:

If port 8050 is busy, change the port in the script:
python
Copy code
app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8051)
Incorrect Predictions:

Use Predicto’s insights and backtesting to identify issues and re-train the model as needed.
