Stock Prediction Model
Real-Time Monitoring, Advanced Machine Learning, and GPT-4 Integration

Overview
This project is an innovative stock prediction and trading system that leverages cutting-edge machine learning, reinforcement learning, real-time data streaming, and AI-powered sentiment analysis. A key element of this model is behavioral profiling, which goes beyond numbers to capture the psychology of stocks, giving the model a unique edge in the market.

Features
Data Integration: Seamlessly pulls historical prices, news sentiment, and alternative data using APIs like FMP, Twitter, and NewsAPI.
Ensemble Models: Combines multiple models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM, and GRU) for better prediction accuracy.
Reinforcement Learning Agents: Adaptive strategies powered by PPO, A2C, and DDPG.
Predicto API Integration:
Fetches alternative forecasts to complement the modelâ€™s predictions.
Fine-tunes the model through comparison and backtesting.
Explainable AI (SHAP): Makes the modelâ€™s predictions transparent by showing which features influence decisions.
Monte Carlo Simulations: Validates predictions by simulating multiple market scenarios.
Portfolio Optimization: Uses Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity to optimize investment strategies.
Real-Time Alerts: Monitors market volatility and sends alerts for major changes.
GPT-4 Chatbot: Lets users ask stock-related questions in natural language and get insights instantly.
Secret Behavioral Layer: A proprietary psychological profiling system helps the model predict stock behavior like a seasoned trader.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+ installed.
Git installed to clone the repository.
Virtual environment (recommended) to isolate dependencies.
Installation and Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/stock-prediction-model.git
cd stock-prediction-model
Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
conda create -n stock-env python=3.8
conda activate stock-env
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Add API Keys:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:

plaintext
Copy code
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_bearer_token
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
PREDICTO_API_KEY=your_predicto_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Running the Application
Run the Main Script:

bash
Copy code
python Base.py
Access the Dashboard:
Open your browser and go to:

plaintext
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8050
Usage Guide
Enter a Stock Symbol (e.g., AAPL) to retrieve real-time predictions and sentiment analysis.
Compare Predictions with Predicto Forecasts:
View Predictoâ€™s insights alongside your modelâ€™s forecasts to detect discrepancies.
Use the comparison to fine-tune the model dynamically.
Monitor Portfolio and Market Regimes:
Track the Kelly Criterion and risk parity allocations for your investments.
Ask GPT-4 Questions:
Use the query box to ask questions like:
plaintext
Copy code
"Whatâ€™s the outlook for Tesla?"  
"Is AAPL a good buy right now?"  
Receive Alerts: Get notified about significant market events, such as a 5% drop in stock prices.
Secret Behavioral Layer
This system doesnâ€™t just crunch numbersâ€”it thinks like a trader. Using proprietary psychological profiling techniques, the model identifies stocks as one of several personality types. These profiles influence trading signals and enhance decision-making dynamically in ways that purely quantitative models cannot.

Want to know how it works? Thatâ€™s a secret only the model knows. ðŸ˜‰

Predicto Integration and Usage
What is Predicto?
Predicto provides market forecasts and predictions via API, offering another layer of insight. It helps ensure the modelâ€™s predictions stay on point through comparison and retraining.

How It Works in the System:
The model compares its predictions with Predictoâ€™s forecasts.
If discrepancies are detected, the model undergoes retraining to improve accuracy.
Potential Issues and Troubleshooting
API Failures:

If an API (like Predicto) is down, predictions will continue without comparison. A warning will appear in the console.
Missing Dependencies:

If packages are missing, install them manually:
bash
Copy code
pip install <package-name>
Port Conflict:

If port 8050 is busy, change the port in the script:
python
Copy code
app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8051)
Incorrect Predictions:

Use Predicto insights and backtesting to identify issues and retrain the model as needed.
