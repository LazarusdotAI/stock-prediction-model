Launch Instructions for Stock Prediction Model
How to Set Up and Run the Program Securely

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/stock-prediction-model.git
cd stock-prediction-model
Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
For Conda Users:

bash
Copy code
conda create -n stock-env python=3.8
conda activate stock-env
For Virtualenv Users:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv stock-env
source stock-env/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
stock-env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Ensure you are inside the stock-prediction-model directory.
Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Secure API Keys and Private Data
To keep your API keys safe, use an environment file (.env) that only you and trusted users can access. Follow these steps:

Create a .env File in the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
touch .env  # For Mac/Linux
echo > .env  # For Windows
Add the following keys inside the .env file:

plaintext
Copy code
FMP_API_KEY=your_fmp_api_key
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_twitter_bearer_token
NEWSAPI_KEY=your_newsapi_key
PREDICTO_API_KEY=your_predicto_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Keep the .env file private:

Add the following line to the .gitignore file to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub:
plaintext
Copy code
.env
Ensure API keys are loaded securely: The application will automatically load your API keys from the .env file. No need to hard-code sensitive information!

Step 5: Run the Application
Launch the Program from the root directory:

bash
Copy code
python Base.py
Access the Dashboard by opening your web browser and navigating to:

plaintext
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:8050
Step 6: Verify the Program is Running Correctly
Test the Stock Symbol Input:

Enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL) in the dashboard.
You should see real-time predictions, sentiment analysis, and personality profiling appear.
Interact with the GPT-4 Interface:

Use the query box to ask questions like:
plaintext
Copy code
"Whatâ€™s the outlook for Tesla?"  
"Should I buy AAPL right now?"  
Receive Alerts:

Monitor if the system sends an alert if market conditions trigger a threshold, such as a 5% drop in stock price.
Step 7: Troubleshooting Tips
API Rate Limits:

If any API (like Predicto) is unavailable, the program will continue, and a warning will appear in the console.
Port Conflicts:

If port 8050 is already in use, modify the port in Base.py:
python
Copy code
app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8051)
Missing Dependencies:

If a package is missing, install it manually:
bash
Copy code
pip install <package-name>
How to Shut Down the Program Safely
Stop the Program:

Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop the server.
Deactivate the Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy code
conda deactivate  # If using Conda
deactivate         # If using Virtualenv
Security Best Practices
Never share your .env file or API keys publicly.
Ensure the .env file is listed in .gitignore to avoid accidental uploads.
Use different API keys for testing versus production environments.
